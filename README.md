## üéØ Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a web-based honeypot capable of capturing and analyzing reverse shell attacks. This enables a deeper understanding of how attackers exploit vulnerable web applications and how forensic techniques can detect, trace, and analyze such attacks.

**Goals:**
- Deploy a web honeypot server to attract attackers
- Simulate a reverse shell attack from a second machine
- Analyze and document attack behavior and forensic evidence

## üîß Project Walkthrough

### Step 1: Honeypot Server Setup
A basic vulnerable web application was developed using the Python Flask framework. This server served as the target for simulated attacks.

### Step 2: Web Page with Logging Feature
A simple upload-enabled web page was added to the honeypot to track:
- IP addresses of visitors
- Uploaded files and metadata
- Access attempts to restricted resources

### Step 3: Simulated Reverse Shell Attack
From a second machine on the same network (both using Kali Linux), a crafted reverse shell script was uploaded through the honeypot interface.

### Step 4: Remote Shell Access Gained
Upon executing the uploaded script, a reverse connection was established:
- Remote shell access was obtained on the honeypot
- Arbitrary commands could be executed remotely
- Simulated a real-world system compromise

### Step 5: Forensic Data Capture
The honeypot successfully logged all attack activity, including:
- Attacker‚Äôs IP address
- Filename, upload timestamp, and location of the uploaded script
- Access logs detailing HTTP requests and executed commands

## üîç Forensic Insights

The logs collected from the honeypot provide:
- Concrete digital evidence of attack methods
- Behavioral analysis of attacker actions
- Resources for legal, academic, or incident response reporting

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates:
- How a web honeypot can be leveraged to study reverse shell exploitation
- The use of logging and analysis for digital forensics
- The importance of controlled environments in understanding cybersecurity threats

The captured data serves as a valuable tool for enhancing security practices, training forensic analysts, and responding to real-world incidents.
